You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  
* What has been easy?
  
* What has been difficult?
  
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I have learned about semantic HTML5 tags and upgraded page created in the Competition.
* It was not difficult because of extensive but useful content on MDM and w3schools.
* I had some additional questions for my mentor about tags usage.
